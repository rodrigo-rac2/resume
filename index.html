<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I'm a senior software test engineer specializing in quality assurance automation and implementing test strategies in core Java / Javascript / Python frameworks such as Cypress and Selenium, as well as unit and API tests in various frameworks with Continuous Testing in AWS / GCP and integrated into CI / CD pipelines like Jenkins, GitHub Actions and others, to ensure quality applications.</li>
    <li>I've worked as an automation tester in multifunctional and self-organizing agile Scrum / Kanban teams for over 18 years. I developed solutions for companies like Google, Riot Games, IBM, Siemens, and Motorola.</li>
    <li>My background has allowed me to establish positive communication and collaboration in all the teams I worked on over the last few years, whether within the test team as a tech lead, with developers, or with external stakeholders. I mentor junior team members daily, helping them sharpen essential skills for quality engineers, like problem-solving and orientation to detail.</li>
    <li>I lived abroad and can communicate in English at a fluent-to-native level, having scored 109/120 in TOEFL iBT a few years ago.</li>
